#  Rewardz Mini Project

Assumptions
We get value from api for the homepage

For the homepage,  
I assign the tableview using ContentType and currently the homepage tableview based on contents array
Items in contents is fully dynamic, it depends on the api call (for this case using static)
For item in contentHeader, it is a segmented control, whenever it changed its value, it will change the value from contents array, and refresh the specific index from tableview
